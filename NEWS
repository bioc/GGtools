SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o  twSnpScreen added to deal with transcriptome-wide (as opposed
       to gene-specific) tests for eQTL for a given racExSet
       (N.B. when the snpMatrix-based representation comes in
       there will be genome-wide searches as well)

    o  plot_EvG includes boxplots

INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES

    o  The inst/ggsite* folders are gone.  inst/GGEXsite is the
       new repository for CGIwithR interface, and Makefiles
       and Makevars are now provided to simplify deployment.
       ggexplorer.org uses the revised infrastructure.
