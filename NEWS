CHANGES IN VERSION 4.7
----------------------

    o  The sensanal() function now operates on a sensiCisInput instance to
       help provide an overview of sensitivity analysis for cis-eQTL searches

CHANGES IN VERSION 4.6
----------------------

    o  The primary tools for one-population analyses are best.cis.eQTLs and
       transScores.  Multipopulation analyses are handled with 
       meta.best.cis.eQTLs and meta.transScores.

    o  High volume genotype data has been addressed by packaging ExpressionSet
       and chromosome-specific SnpMatrix instances; requests for expression
       plus genotype data are directed to packages mediated through 
       GGBase::getSS.

    o  Two species of data filtering parameters that may be used jointly 
       in the primary tools are exFilter, which operates on expression 
       component prior to any analyses, and smFilter, which operates on the
       entire smlSet.  exFilter may be used to isolate samples of interest
       early in the workflow, for example when an expression plus genotype
       package includes samples from distinct tissues on the same individuals.

    o  june 2012: exFilter facility properly handled in best.cis.eQTLs.mchr

    o  may 2012: best.cis.eQTLs has getDFFITS option

    o  march 2010: gwSnpTests and so forth are deprecated in favor
       of simpler interfaces that can be more readily parallelized.  New
       IRanges-based computations for cis restrictions will be introduced


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0
----------------------

    o  march 2008: complete overhaul to use snpMatrix genotype 
       representation.  gwSnpScreen is main interface

    o  manage warnings of ff.[ a bit better, May 13 2012

    o  racExSet is not a primary tool any more; smlSet is
