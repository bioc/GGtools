Working with WebQTL-related resources to deploy GGtools with mouse

1) genotypes

We use the http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS Strain files and
the Strain2rac function of GGtools

2) expression

WebQTL provides various CEL file archives, but GEO accession numbers
are also available, with strains labeled (apparently) in sync with
Wellcome

3) phenotypes

Manually extracted from WebQTL tables.
