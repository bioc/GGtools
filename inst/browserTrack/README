Here is how a serialized trackSet (cpneTrack.rda, serialized
July 20 2008) can be rendered (after reconfiguring
custom tracks to 'full' and running macosx screen capture)

> load("cpneTrack.rda")
> sess = browserSession("ucsc")
> sess = layTrack(sess, cpneTrack, name="CPNE1 -log10p", view=TRUE)

now look at the browser and reconfigure the custom track to
full format
