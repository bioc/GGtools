create R package with decomposable smlSet representation

\usage{
externalize(smlSet, 
  packname, 
  author = "Replace Me <auth@a.b.com>", 
  maintainer = "Replace Me <repl@a.b.com>")
getSS( packname, chrs, renameChrs=NULL, probesToKeep=NULL,

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{smlSet}{
instance of \code{\link[GGBase]{smlSet-class}}
}
  \item{packname}{
arbitrary string naming the package that will hold the
externalized representation -- this should not coincide with
the name of any installed package, as such would be overwritten
}
  \item{author}{
string that should be a valid Author: entry for  a DESCRIPTION file
}
  \item{maintainer}{
string that should be a valid Maintainer: entry for  a DESCRIPTION file
}
  \item{chrs}{vector of strings naming chromosomes to be
included in the \code{\link[GGBase]{smlSet-class}} instance
created by \code{getSS}}
  \item{renameChrs}{if non-null, the names of the \code{smList}
component of the \code{\link[GGBase]{smlSet-class}} will be set
to the value of \code{renameChrs}}
  \item{probesToKeep}{a vector used as G in X[G,...] for filtering probes in use,
chiefly to get smaller scale computations}
 \item{wrapperEndo}{a function that takes an smlSet as input and returns an smlSet; this will be
evaluated with the getSS request (minus wrapperEndo) result, and validObject
will be run on this result before returning}
}
\details{
Each \code{\link[snpStats]{SnpMatrix-class}} instance in the
\code{smlEnv} slot of \code{smlSet} is written to disk
in a folder inst/parts of the source package generated by this
function.  The \code{\link[Biobase]{ExpressionSet-class}} instance
in the \code{smlSet} is isolated and saved as \code{eset.rda} 
to the data folder
of the source package generated by this function.  

\code{getSS} will construct an \code{\link[GGBase]{smlSet-class}}
instance with the expression data and selected chromosomes
}
\value{
instance of \code{\link[GGBase]{smlSet-class}}

\note{
The purpose is to avoid loading very large objects as
SNP panels grow into the millions.  With this approach 
in-memory images can be chromosome-size, or smaller if desired,
depending on the structure of \code{smList(smlSet)}.
